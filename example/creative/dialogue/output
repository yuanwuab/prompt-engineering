INT. INTERROGATION ROOM – NIGHT
Flickering fluorescent lights. A ticking clock. Rain taps against the window. DETECTIVE VEGA stands, arms crossed. SUSPECT JONES sits across the table, wrists cuffed, eyes darting.

DETECTIVE VEGA
Midnight. Where were you?

SUSPECT JONES
Told your guy already — home. Watching the game.

DETECTIVE VEGA
You watch alone?

SUSPECT JONES
Yeah.

DETECTIVE VEGA
That’s convenient.

SUSPECT JONES
(glares)
What’s that supposed to mean?

DETECTIVE VEGA
Means no one saw you not kill her.

SUSPECT JONES
I didn’t even know the girl.

DETECTIVE VEGA
Her name was Emily. Seventeen. Walked home from the diner every night. Ring a bell?

SUSPECT JONES
No.

DETECTIVE VEGA
Funny. Your prints were on the fence near Miller’s Creek. Same spot they found her bag.

SUSPECT JONES
I walk there sometimes. Everyone does.

DETECTIVE VEGA
Everyone doesn’t leave blood on a rock.

SUSPECT JONES
(leans in)
You think I did this ‘cause I’ve got no alibi?

DETECTIVE VEGA
I think you did this ‘cause you thought no one’d care. Small town. No trouble in twenty years. People get lazy.

SUSPECT JONES
(scoffs)
You’re reaching.

DETECTIVE VEGA
You left her face down in the creek. That wasn’t an accident. That was fear. Panic.

SUSPECT JONES
(tight jaw)
You got nothing.

DETECTIVE VEGA
(smiles coldly)
Not yet.

(Beat. Jones’s eyes twitch. Vega drops a photo of Emily — smiling, alive — on the table.)

DETECTIVE VEGA
She had a little brother. Just turned nine.

(Jones stares at the photo. Silence presses in. The clock ticks louder.)

CUT TO:
A hallway monitor blinks on. Forensics file uploads — DNA results pending.

Scene: a detective interrogates a suspect in a dim room.
The town is quiet outside, but inside the station, the air hangs heavy.
One teenager was found dead in the woods last night — the first murder here in 20 years.

DETECTIVE VEGA (cool, deliberate):
You ever walk alone out past Miller Creek?

SUSPECT JONES (shrugs, evasive):
Sometimes. It’s quiet out there.

DETECTIVE VEGA:
Quiet enough to kill?

SUSPECT JONES (eyes narrow):
Is that what this is? You think I killed that kid?

DETECTIVE VEGA (leans forward):
You tell me. You were seen near the woods. Midnight.

SUSPECT JONES:
Seen by who?

DETECTIVE VEGA:
You want to test how deep I’ll dig?

SUSPECT JONES (leans back, crosses arms):
You’re fishing.

DETECTIVE VEGA (sharp):
Fishing doesn’t leave blood on boots.

SUSPECT JONES (beat, then scoffs):
I hike, alright? Doesn’t mean I bury bodies.

DETECTIVE VEGA:
You know his name?

SUSPECT JONES:
Everyone knows his name now.

DETECTIVE VEGA:
That wasn’t the question.

SUSPECT JONES (tight):
Yeah, I knew him. He was loud. Stupid. Always running his mouth.

DETECTIVE VEGA:
And now he’s quiet.

(Silence. Jones stares at the table.)

DETECTIVE VEGA (softer, but razor-edged):
You want to tell me how the blood ended up on your shirt?

SUSPECT JONES (almost whispers):
It wasn’t supposed to go that far.

(A long pause. Vega doesn't move. The overhead light hums.)

[Beat. Vega slowly stands, leaving the silence to press in as the tape recorder clicks louder.]

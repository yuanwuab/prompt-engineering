**The Watchmaker’s Dream**

Mira lived where time broke gently against the shore — a town where fog slept on rooftops and the sea kept its secrets. Her hands, steady from years of fixing fractured gears, trembled when she found the backward-ticking watch resting on her windowsill. The casing was etched with an unfamiliar crest: an eye watching a wave.

Each night after, sleep bent sideways. She saw a man in oilskin stumble through stormlight, clutching a lantern. A lighthouse towered behind him, windows blackened, the beacon extinguished. He whispered a name: **“Mira.”** With each tick in reverse, the visions clawed closer to waking. Her mother had once called her father a liar. Her grandfather had vanished without goodbye.

Fog laced her boots as she climbed the cliff path. The lighthouse door groaned open. Dust lay like snow, undisturbed for years. In the mirror, her reflection flickered — then became the man from her dreams. He wore the same eyes, her eyes. “You were never meant to forget,” he said, voice ringing in the brass bones of the room.

The watch trembled in her palm. She rewound it forward, slowly, teeth gritted as the hands stuttered past midnight. The storm in the mirror ceased. Her grandfather blinked once — then vanished. Outside, the beacon ignited, casting wide arcs over the sea as gulls shrieked their approval.

Mira descended the cliff path, salt on her lips and time at her back, knowing some secrets weren’t lost — only waiting to be wound.

### Short Story (Poetic Mystery)

Mist kissed the rooftops of Larkhollow as Iris traced ink across brittle vellum, her fingers trembling where the sea wind slipped beneath the shutters. The map, unearthed from a rusted chest in her grandfather’s attic, bore no roads—only winding lines like veins, and a crimson “X” where the chapel now stood. The town bells tolled noon, their voice swallowed by the fog, as if mourning something long buried.

At dusk, the Bell Girl came. Barefoot, silent, she pressed a folded drawing into Iris’s hand: a charcoal tower spewing bones from its belfry. Her eyes—wide, unblinking—spoke where her mouth could not. Iris followed the girl’s gaze to the chapel window, where Father Merrin lit a candle with hands that shook like dead leaves. He looked at her then—too long, too knowingly—and turned the key in the vestry door.

Inside the chapel, salt hung in the air like ghosts. Iris crept through candlelight and dust, her boots soundless on the stone. Behind the altar, beneath a false panel, she found them: rows of skulls, jawless, hollow, each marked with the faintest rune. A storm, long ago, had swallowed the town’s vanished. Not the sea, but silence had buried them here—ritually, deliberately.

Father Merrin, pale as ash, confessed with eyes alone. “We rang the bells to forget,” he rasped. “We mapped over the graves.” The Bell Girl stood at the doorway, her bell swinging without sound. Iris did not weep—she inked every bone’s position, each name she could guess. The town would remember now.

And the Bell Girl, once mute, sang that night in her sleep—an old hymn, carried on wind, as if the storm had finally exhaled.
